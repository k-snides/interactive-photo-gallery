### Interactive Photo Gallery

The 4th project of 12 in the TreeHouse Front End Web Development TechDegree

In this project, you will create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and jQuery. Thumbnails and photos will be provided with descriptions.

At the top of the page you'll have a search area where photos will hide and show depending on user input. When the user clicks on a thumbnail the photo will display in a lightbox. There should be a back and previous buttons to cycle through photos.

Project will be coded from viewing a mockup. No code is provided.
